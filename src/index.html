    <h1>Cows and bulls</h1>
    <h3>Rules:</h3>
    <div class="rules">
        <p>The rules are very simple: When you press the start button the game will generate random 4-digit number (numbers cannot be repeated eg. 1234 is valid but 1223 is not valid) and you will have to guess the number. You need to enter 4-digit numebr in the free cell and the game will return the number of cows and bulls you have. Cow means that there is correct digit but NOT AT ITS ORIGINAL PLACE and Bull means that there is CORRECT NUMEBR AT THE CORRECT PLACE.</p>
